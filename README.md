#The "Movie Recommendation System" is built using Python and runs on the Jupyter Notebook. It creates a system for recommending movies depending on user input. It preprocesses movie data by merging attributes such as genres, keywords, taglines, cast and director, then vectorizes the text using TfidfVectorizer. Lastly, by computing the cosine similarity between movie vectors, it recommends movies that are similar to a given one.
